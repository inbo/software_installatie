      <description>During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians. Most of these courses have been developed and taught in-house. Some (mostly advanced) courses were taught in-house by external teachers.
While we do plan to periodically repeat these courses for new employees and as a refresher, the course material can always be consulted and used for self-teaching or as a reference.</description>

      <description>This document is a quick and dirty illustration of how spatially correlated random effect can be fit with INLA. It is based on the question and the data posted on the R-Sig-mixedmodels mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mixed-models/2016q3/024938.html.

      <description>These workshops are a follow-up of the course on &amp;ldquo;Spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal models using R-INLA&amp;rdquo; by Alain Zuur and Elena Ieno (Highland Statistics Ltd.). The main goal is the get people using R-INLA with their own data in a workshop setting so they can tap into the knowledge of others. The workshops are not a copy of the Highstat course but elaborate certain topics. We also introduce the inlatools and inlabru.</description>
