      <description>googlesheets4 The R package googlesheets4 provides the functionality to read and write data from a Google sheet.
This package is very well documented, so we just have to provide you with the right links:
 read sheets write sheets  There are also two specific in-depth articles: one about reading and one about writing sheets.
A complete list of vignettes can be found in the Articles page.
