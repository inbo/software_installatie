      <description>At the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), we are eager to sustain, promote and develop open-source software that is relevant to biodiversity researchers! This page lists R and Python packages which INBO developed or made a significant contribution to. Several of these packages continue being developed.
Please, feel free to try out packages! If you encounter a problem or if you have a suggestion, we encourage you to post an issue on the packageâ€™s code repository.</description>

      <title>Updating the renv environment of an R project</title>

      <description>What is renv? renv is an R package that provides tools to save the version of R and all packages used in a particular directory with R code (e.g. an RStudio project directory), and to reproduce (recreate) this environment on another (or your future) system. Because software versions can have important effects on the results of your work, it is important to be able to reproduce versions.
Start using renv For general advice on renv setup and usage, see https://rstudio.</description>

      <description>Set up continuous integration with Wercker There are 2 major steps to set up continuous integration:
 create a wercker.yml file in the package add the application (package) to Wercker.com  To be able to add a package to Wercker, one must have administrator rights on the package repository on Github.
The Wercker test environment can only be set up if the file wercker.yml is commited to the repository, but Wercker is triggered to start checking when the application is added to wercker.</description>

      <description>R CMD check has a large set of generic quality tests on a package. It is impossible to create generic tests that check the content of the package. E.g. does each function return sensible results. However, R CMD check does run a set unit tests. These are small pieces of code written by the package developer which test the output of a specific function under specific circumstances. We highly recommend the testthat framework for writing unit tests.</description>
