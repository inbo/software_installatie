      <description>At the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), we are eager to sustain, promote and develop open-source software that is relevant to biodiversity researchers! This page lists R and Python packages which INBO developed or made a significant contribution to. Several of these packages continue being developed.
Please, feel free to try out packages! If you encounter a problem or if you have a suggestion, we encourage you to post an issue on the packageâ€™s code repository.</description>
