      <description>Enter VME mode With the advent of RStudio version 1.4+, working with bibliographies and citing documents in R Markdown has much improved. In this tutorial we focus on best practices to further ease the citation experience when working with R Markdown documents. We also give some guidelines specific to the Research Institute for Nature and Forest.
More general tutorials can be found at the following web pages:
 https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html  The latter webpage is part of the documentation about the Visual Markdown Editing (VME) mode that is available since RStudio 1.</description>

      <description>This page lists selected literature and online resources. Some are related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are supposed to be of high interest to this site’s users.
Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring talk by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.
These resources focus on the learning and teaching aspect, while they often also give an overview of scientific computing workflows.</description>

      <description>McElreath (2015): Statistical Rethinking is an introduction to applied Bayesian data analysis, aimed at PhD students and researchers in the natural and social sciences. This audience has had some calculus and linear algebra, and one or two joyless undergraduate courses in statistics. I’ve been teaching applied statistics to this audience for about a decade now, and this book has evolved from that experience. The book teaches generalized linear multilevel modeling (GLMMs) from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy.</description>
