This page lists **selected** literature and online resources. Some are related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are supposed to be of high interest to this site's users.

Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring
[talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KkXEv4r3wWtdKvB6RFOPe809eMNldODaRqQxn-jeME/edit?usp=sharing) 
by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.
