This page lists **selected** literature and online resources. Some are
related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are
supposed to be of high interest to this site’s users.

Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring
[talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KkXEv4r3wWtdKvB6RFOPe809eMNldODaRqQxn-jeME/edit?usp=sharing)
by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.

These resources focus on the discipline as a whole, its perception,
principles, etc., while they often also give an overview of [scientific
computing workflows](../computing).

-   Ibanez *et al.* (2014): open and reproducible science: vision,
    routine practices, collaboration, literate computing
-   Hampton *et al.* (2015): workflows, tools, obstacles and needed
    mindshifts for open science
-   Donati & Woolston (2017): how data science is becoming a large
    discipline

## Focus on reproducible research

-   Stodden *et al.* (2014): **book** on computational reproducibility
    and (experiment) replicability; the three parts are *Tools*,
    *Practices and Guidelines*, *Platforms*
-   Stodden & Miguez (2014): a formalized set of **best practice
    recommendations** for reproducible research
-   Begley *et al.* (2015): current **irreproducibility** and good
    institutional practice
-   ROpenSci Contributors (2018): a comprehensive **overview** of
    aspects and R-oriented tools in reproducible research
