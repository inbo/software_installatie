This page lists **selected** literature and online resources. Some are related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are supposed to be of high interest to this site's users.

Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring
[talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KkXEv4r3wWtdKvB6RFOPe809eMNldODaRqQxn-jeME/edit?usp=sharing) 
by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.

These resources focus on the learning and teaching aspect, while they often also give an overview of [scientific computing workflows](../computing).

## Open data science in general

- @lowndes_our_2017: **learning** open data science tools
- @hampton_skills_2017: **training approaches and needed skills** in data science
- @stevens_building_2018: **local community of practice** for scientific programming: why, how (including scheme), challenges
- @national_center_for_ecological_analysis__synthesis_openscapes_2020: **resources** for learning, collaborating and inspiring others

## In relation to statistics teaching

- @kaplan_teaching_2017: ten organizing blocks for **introductory statistics teaching** in the present data science context
- @cetinkaya-rundel_infrastructure_2017: **computational infrastructure and toolkit choices** to allow for the necessary pedagogical innovations in statistics education
