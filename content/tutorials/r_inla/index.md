These workshops are a follow-up of the course on "Spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal models using [R-INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/)" by Alain Zuur and Elena Ieno ([Highland Statistics Ltd.](http://www.highstat.com)). The main goal is the get people using R-INLA with their own data in a workshop setting so they can tap into the knowledge of others. The workshops are not a copy of the Highstat course but elaborate certain topics. We also introduce the [`inlatools`](https://inlatools.netlify.com) and [`inlabru`](http://inlabru.org).

## Workshop 1

Fitting models with only fixed effects, random intercepts and first order random walk.

- [slides](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_inla/random_intercept.pdf)
- [source code and data](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/tree/master/content/tutorials/r_inla/random_intercept)

## Workshop 2

`inlabru` versus `INLA` for fixed effects, random intercepts and random walks.

- [slides](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_inla/inlabru.pdf)
- [source code and data](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/tree/master/content/tutorials/r_inla/inlabru)

## Workshop 3

Fitting models with spatial correlation
