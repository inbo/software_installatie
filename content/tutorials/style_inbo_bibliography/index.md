# The INBO citation style

Most journals, publishers and companies use a specified format for
citations and bibliographies. The Research Institute for Nature and
Forest (INBO) is no exception.

All bibliography managers provide ways to automate the formatting of
citations and bibliographies which greatly facilitates scientific
publishing. Depending on the bibliographic manager software, the style
formatting rules are stored in specific files. In this tutorial you will
learn how to use the INBO citation style in EndNote, Mendeley and Zotero
bibliography managers.

EndNote uses a `*.ens` file to store the style formatting rules, whereas
Mendeley and Zotero use the open standard `*.csl` ([Citation Style
Language](https://citationstyles.org/)). EndNote, Zotero and Mendeley
have recommended ways of finding and installing these files and will
always point to the latest version of the style files when properly
installed. This is explained in [Use in bibliography
managers](#use-in-bibliography-managers).

In case you want to manually download the latest official CSL file of
the INBO citation style (not the recommended way; better use your
bibliography manager): it is
[available](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest.csl)
at the CSL style repository. In case older versions are needed, they can
be obtained from successively numbered releases from our [forked styles
repo](https://github.com/inbo/styles/releases). To use older versions,
you will need to manually download and add the file to your bibliography
manager.

The EndNote `*.ens` file can be downloaded
[here](https://sites.google.com/a/inbo.be/intranet/ondersteuning/bibliotheek/endnote-informatie/endnotehuisstijl)
(only accessible for INBO employees).

for various document types? Take a look at these links:

Guidelines on how to use Mendeley in combination with MS Word or
LibreOffice can be found
[here](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/using-citation-editor).

## EndNote
