## Coordinate reference systems: minimal background

### What?

A coordinate reference system (**CRS**) -- also called spatial reference system (SRS) -- is what you need if you want to interpret numeric coordinates as actual point locations with reference to the Earth.
Two types of coordinate reference system exist: _geodetic_ and _projected_ CRSs.
The former serve only to locate coordinates relative to a 3D model of the Earth surface, while the latter add a projection to generate coordinates on a 2D map.
Coordinate operations convert or transform coordinates from one CRS to another, and you often need them because the CRS may differ between dataset 1, dataset 2 or a specific mapping technology (such as `leaflet`).

As you can expect, a CRS is defined by several elements.
Essentially, a CRS exists of:

- a coordinate system,
- a 'datum' (s.l.): it localizes the geodetic coordinate system relative to the Earth and needs a geometric definition of the ellipsoid,
- _only for projected CRSs:_ coordinate conversion parameters that determine the conversion from the geodetic to the projected coordinates.

We will not go deeper into these components, because we want to focus on implementation.
However it is highly recommended to read further about this, in order to better understand what a CRS means.
A good contemporary resource in an R context is the section '_Coordinate reference systems: background_' in @bivand_ecs530_2019 (there is also an accompanying [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgn4Ns2UgAg&list=PLXUoTpMa_9s10NVk4dBQljNOaOXAOhcE0&index=4&t=0s) of that lesson).

There are a few coordinated lists of CRSs around the globe, the most famous one being the [EPSG dataset](https://www.epsg.org), where each CRS has a unique _EPSG code_.
You can consult these CRSs interactively at <https://epsg.org> (official source) and through third-party websites such as <http://epsg.io>.
For example, the 'World Geodetic System 1984' (WGS84) is a geodetic CRS with EPSG code `4326`, and 'Belge 1972 / Belgian Lambert 72' is a projected CRS with EPSG code `31370`.

### How _did_ we represent a CRS in R? Evolutions in PROJ and GDAL.

It is good to know this, but you _can_ skip this section if you like.

The reason for writing this tutorial are the recent (and ongoing) changes in several important geospatial libraries, especially **GDAL** and **PROJ**.
They are used by most geospatial tools, including the key geospatial R packages `rgdal`, `sp`, `sf`, `stars`, `terra` and `raster`.

Since long, coordinate reference systems in R (and many other tools) have been represented by so called 'PROJ.4 strings' (or 'proj4strings'), referring to the long-standing version 4 of the PROJ library.
But, we will not use them here!
It is discouraged to use 'PROJ strings'[^projstring] any longer to represent a CRS; several string elements for CRSs are now deprecated or unsupported.
Currently, PROJ (<https://proj.org>) regards PROJ strings only as a means of specifying a _coordinate operation_ (conversions or transformations _between_ CRSs).
Performing coordinate operations is the main aim of PROJ.

[^projstring]: 'PROJ string' is the term used in current PROJ documentation.
Here, we only use 'PROJ.4 string' (or 'proj4string') when referring specifically to the PROJ string appearance in version 4 of the PROJ software.

Let's just have **one last nostalgic peek** (and then, no more!!) to the proj4string for EPSG:31370, the Belgian Lambert 72 CRS [^belge72]:

    +proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.367486666666666 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-106.8686,52.2978,-103.7239,0.3366,-0.457,1.8422,-1.2747 +units=m +no_defs

[^belge72]: Note that the _currently returned_ PROJ string for EPSG:31370, if requested from PROJ ≥ 6 or GDAL 3 (not shown), lacks the datum reference which, in PROJ.4, was defined indirectly by `+towgs84` with the 7-parameter (Helmert) transformation to the WGS84 datum.
Hence the current PROJ string is a deficient representation of EPSG:31370.

Several reasons have led to recent changes in GDAL and PROJ, such as the former use of the WGS84 CRS as an intermediate 'hub' in coordinate transformation or in defining a CRS's datum (introducing unneeded errors), higher accuracy requirements in transformations and the availability of better CRS specification standards than PROJ strings.
The changes are included in **GDAL 3** and **PROJ ≥ 6**, which many R packages now support and promote.

In consequence, support for PROJ strings to represent a CRS is reduced and discouraged.
It _can_ still be done, preferrably adding the `+type=crs` element to distinguish such a string from modern PROJ strings.
The latter represent a coordinate operation, not a CRS.
Currently, support for most geodetic datums is already lacking in PROJ strings [^projcrs] (unless one defines it indirectly, but likely less accurately, with the now deprecated `+towgs84` key).
The WGS84 ensemble datum [^wgs84] ([datum:EPSG::6326](https://epsg.org/datum_6326/World-Geodetic-System-1984-ensemble.html)) is now by default assumed for a CRS declared with a PROJ string.

[^projcrs]: Formerly, more geodetic datums could be specified in a PROJ string with the `+datum` key.
Currently only `WGS84`, `NAD27` and `NAD83` are still supported this way.
Further, if an ellipsoid is specified with `+ellps` (and that includes the WGS84 ellipsoid), the datum of the resulting CRS is considered as 'unknown'.
The usage of PROJ strings to define CRSs, including the `+datum` and `+towgs84` elements, will remain supported for mere backward compatibility (to support existing data sets), but is regarded deprecated and is discouraged by PROJ.

[^wgs84]: An [ensemble datum](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/18-005r4/18-005r4.html#97) is a collection of different but closely related datum realizations without making a distinction between them.
By not specifying the applicable datum realization for a coordinate data set, some degree of inaccuracy is allowed when using an ensemble datum as part of a CRS.

### What _is_ the new way to represent a CRS in R?

**Answer**: The current approach is the **[WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html) string**, a recent and much better standard, maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium.
WKT stands for 'Well-known text'.
'WKT2' is simply the recent version of WKT, approved in 2019, so you can also refer to it as WKT. [^WKT2]

[^WKT2]: In order to emphasize the fact that the improvements in version 2 were instructive to the new versions of GDAL and PROJ, you will often see explicit mention of 'WKT2'.

For example, this is the WKT2 string for WGS84:

```{r echo=FALSE}
wkt_4326 <- sp::wkt(sp::CRS(SRS_string = "EPSG:4326"))
cat(wkt_4326)
```

An alternative representation of the WKT2 string - not yet official at the time of writing - is [PROJJSON](https://proj.org/specifications/projjson.html).
It is a more convenient format to use in coding.

## How to specify a CRS in R?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(sf)
```

Great news!\
The R packages further down, and many that depend on them, now provide a means of CRS specification _irrespective_ of the GDAL/PROJ version, hence compliant with newer GDAL/PROJ.

- **DO:**

  **The _general principle_ that we recommend is: specify the CRS by using the _EPSG code_, but do so _without_ using a PROJ string.**
  
  _Note: in case you wish to define a custom CRS yourself, ideally use WKT2 or its more convenient [PROJJSON](https://proj.org/specifications/projjson.html) counterpart._

- **DON'T:**

  **It's no longer advised to use PROJ strings to specify a CRS, such as `+init=epsg:????`, `+proj=longlat`, ... (even though that _might_ still work, their usage is discouraged).**

Below it is demonstrated how to specify a CRS that is defined in the EPSG database (hence, having an EPSG code), for several important geospatial R packages: **`sf`**, **`sp`** and **`raster`**.
Other geospatial R packages should normally inherit their approach.

First, a practical note:

- Some packages internally still derive a PROJ string as well.
This happens even while you did not enter a PROJ string.
Note that the derived PROJ string will not be used further if you're on GDAL 3 / PROJ ≥ 6, and a WKT2 string will be generated as well for actual use.
In the presence of GDAL 3 / PROJ ≥ 6 and when using `sp` or `raster`, you will (at the time of writing) get a **warning** from `rgdal` about dropped keys in the generated PROJ strings [^warnings].
You can safely ignore this warning on condition that you didn't define the CRS with a PROJ string.
Also, you can suppress the warning with `options(rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings = "none")` in the beginning of your script (before loading `rgdal` or dependent packages).

[^warnings]: The packages give a warning especially to make developers of _other_, dependent packages _aware_ that they should also make sure their functions do not _require_ PROJ strings or use hardcoded PROJ strings.
Instead, they should defer the handling of CRS representation to the basic geospatial R packages (i.e. dependent on the version of PROJ/GDAL).
So, the appearance of these warnings marks a period of transition in order to let other packages become GDAL 3 and PROJ ≥ 6 compliant.
And the good news is that most popular geospatial packages _have_ become GDAL 3 and PROJ ≥ 6 compliant!

As a demo data set for vector data, we use a dataset of city centers (points) included in the `rgdal` package.


```{r results="hide"}
cities <- 
  st_read(system.file("vectors/cities.shp", package = "rgdal"))
```

This is how it looks like:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
cities
```

We now convert it to a plain dataframe (non-spatial) with the XY coordinates as columns, for the sake of the exercise.
We want to add the CRS ourselves!

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
cities <- 
  cbind(st_drop_geometry(cities), 
        st_coordinates(cities))
head(cities, 10) # top 10 rows
```



### `sf` package

Note that also the [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) package, useful to represent _vector and raster data cubes_, uses the below approach.

Let's check whether **[`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)** uses (for Windows: comes with) the minimal PROJ/GDAL versions that we want!

```{r}
sf::sf_extSoftVersion()
```

Good to go!

#### Defining a CRS with `sf`

You can simply provide the EPSG code using `st_crs()`:

```{r}
crs_wgs84 <- st_crs(4326) # WGS84 has EPSG code 4326
```

It is a so-called `crs` object:

```{r}
class(crs_wgs84)
```

#### Printing the WKT2 string with `sf`

You can directly acces the `wkt` element of the `crs` object:

```{r}
cat(crs_wgs84$wkt)
```

There are a few extras to note:

- printing the `crs` object shows us both the EPSG code (more generally: the user's CRS specification) and the WKT2 string:

```{r}
crs_wgs84
```

- if the user inputted the CRS with an EPSG code (which we did!), the latter can be returned as a number:

```{r}
crs_wgs84$epsg
```

You _can_ (but should you?) export a PROJ string as well, with `crs_wgs84$proj4string`.

#### Set the CRS of an `sf` object

First we prepare an `sf` object from `cities` but still without a CRS:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
cities2 <- st_as_sf(cities, coords = c("X", "Y"))
cities2
```

Note the missing CRS!

Let's add the CRS by using the EPSG code (we could also assign `crs_wgs84` instead):

```{r}
st_crs(cities2) <- 4326
```

Done!

#### Get the CRS of an `sf` object

Really, all you need is `st_crs()`, once more!

```{r}
st_crs(cities2)
```

Great!

As this returns the `crs` object, you can also use `st_crs(cities2)$wkt` to specifically return the WKT2 string!

### `sp` package

Note that the actively developed (and matured) `sf` package is now recommended over the `sp` package (a view also shared by `sf` and `sp` developers).
The **[`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html)** package, which has very long been _the_ go-to package before `sf` matured, is maintained in order to support existing code, but it is not further developed as much.

The `sp` package relies on the `rgdal` R  package to communicate with GDAL and PROJ, so let's check whether `rgdal` uses (for Windows: comes with) the minimal PROJ/GDAL versions that we want.

```{r}
rgdal::rgdal_extSoftVersion()
```

Okido.

#### Defining a CRS with `sp`

```{r}
crs_wgs84 <- CRS(SRS_string = "EPSG:4326") # WGS84 has EPSG code 4326
```

It is a so-called `CRS` object:

```{r}
class(crs_wgs84)
```

#### Printing the WKT2 string with `sp`

```{r}
wkt_wgs84 <- wkt(crs_wgs84)
cat(wkt_wgs84)
```

Also note that, when _printing_ a `CRS` object of `sp` (e.g. by running `crs_wgs84`), you still just get a PROJ string!
We won't print it here!
However do know that the WKT2 string is currently also _contained_ in the `CRS` object, just call `wkt()` to see it.

#### Set the CRS of a `Spatial*` object in `sp`

First we prepare a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` from `cities` but still without a CRS:

```{r}
cities2 <- cities
coordinates(cities2) <-  ~ X + Y
```

Now, we can add a CRS:

```{r}
proj4string(cities2) <- crs_wgs84
```

Note the name of the `proj4string<-` replacement function in `sp`: it still reminds of old days, but the result is GDAL3/PROJ≥6 compliant!
Maybe we'll get another function in the future that cuts the link with the 'proj4string' name.


#### Get the CRS of a `Spatial*` object in `sp`

Again, use `wkt()`: it works on both `CRS` and `Spatial*` objects!

```{r}
cat(wkt(cities2))
```

Et voilà!

### `raster` package

At the time of writing, you still needed the development version of `raster` for the below code to run.
You can install the development version with: `remotes::install_github("rspatial/raster")`.
If below code does not run with the CRAN version (usually obtained with `install.packages()`), use the development version.
Further, be aware that a [`terra`](https://rspatial.org/terra/pkg/) package is in development as a successor to `raster`.
It is aimed at faster processing and it is _only_ compatible with GDAL3/PROJ≥6.

As you will see, **[`raster`](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg/)** more or less aligns with `sp`, although it has a few extras.
For example: `raster` does not require the use of the `proj4string<-` replacement function to set the CRS.
`raster` provides `crs<-`.

Let's make a dummy raster first, without CRS:

```{r}
within_belgium <- 
  raster(extent(188500, 190350, 227550, 229550),
         res = 50)
values(within_belgium) <- 1:ncell(within_belgium)
within_belgium
```

This raster is intended for use in the Belgian Lambert 72 CRS (EPSG 31370).

#### Defining and printing a CRS with `raster`

This is not applicable.
Just use the facilities of the `sp` package if you want to make a separate CRS object for usage in a `Raster*` object (see below).


#### Set the CRS of a `Raster*` object in `raster`

We prepare a few copies of the data:

```{r}
within_belgium1 <- within_belgium
within_belgium2 <- within_belgium
within_belgium3 <- within_belgium
within_belgium4 <- within_belgium
```

Setting the CRS is done with the `crs<-` replacement function.
It can take a multitude of formats; these are all equivalent:

```{r}
crs(within_belgium1) <- 31370
crs(within_belgium2) <- "EPSG:31370"
crs(within_belgium3) <- st_crs(31370)$wkt # a WKT string
crs(within_belgium4) <- CRS(SRS_string = "EPSG:31370") # an sp CRS object
```

Note that we could also have provided the `crs` argument in `raster()`, when creating the `RasterLayer` object.
It can take any of the above formats.

#### Get the CRS of a `Raster*` object in `raster`

It goes the same as in `sp`:

```{r}
cat(wkt(within_belgium1))
```

Let's verify whether all objects do indeed have the same CRS:

```{r}
all.equal(wkt(within_belgium1), wkt(within_belgium2))
all.equal(wkt(within_belgium1), wkt(within_belgium3))
all.equal(wkt(within_belgium1), wkt(within_belgium4))
```

YES!
