_General note: the way the `raster` package handles coordinate reference systems has just recently (at the time of writing) become compliant with recent GDAL 3 and PROJ >= 6 versions._
_At the time of writing, it was necessary to use the current development version of `raster` ([link](https://github.com/rspatial/raster))._
_During the current transition period of supporting both old and new PROJ/GDAL, you may get a decent portion of proj4string-related warnings when running the below code (as seen below), but you can safely ignore them._
_For more information, see the [CRS tutorial](../spatial_crs_coding/)._

```{r include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(googlesheets4)
source("token_option.R")
opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE
)
set.seed(123456789)
unlink("art*")
```


This tutorial uses a few basic functions from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [raster](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg) packages.
While only a few functions are used, you can use the previous hyperlinks to access the tutorials (vignettes) of these packages for more functions and information.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(inborutils)
```

You will find a bit more background about 'why and what', regarding the considered open standards, in [a separate post](../../articles/geospatial_standards/) on this website.

In short, the GeoTIFF and GeoPackage formats are ideal for exchange, publication, interoperability & durability and to open science in general.

The below table compares a few raster formats that are currently used a lot.
This tutorial focuses on the open formats.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gs4_deauth()
range_read("15KVm87QvVis--vyCHa8EQBcXAeQ23M1oaCL_dENempk", 
            sheet = "Raster",
            col_types = "c") %>% 
  kable(align = "lccc")
```

## How to make and use GeoTIFF files (`*.tif`)

### Making a mono-layered GeoTIFF file from a `RasterLayer` R object

Let's create a small dummy `RasterLayer` object from scratch, for some area in Belgium (using the CRS ^[CRS = coordinate reference system] Belgian Lambert 72, i.e. [EPSG-code 31370](https://epsg.io/31370)):

```{r}
artwork <- 
  raster(extent(188500, 190350, 227550, 229550), # xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
         res = 50, # resolution of 50 meters
         crs = 31370) %>% 
  setValues(runif(ncell(.)))  # fill with random values
```

What does this look like?

```{r}
artwork
```

A simple trick to plot this raster:

```{r artwork}
spplot(artwork)
```

To write this `RasterLayer` object as a GeoTIFF, you can use the `raster::writeRaster()` function.
In the background, it uses the GeoTIFF driver of the powerful [GDAL](https://gdal.org) library.

```{r}
artwork %>% 
  writeRaster("artwork.tif")
```

And now?\
_**Say HURRAY!!**_

### Making a multi-layered GeoTIFF file from a `RasterBrick` R object

Let's create a `RasterBrick` object of three layers:

```{r}
arts <- brick(artwork) # RasterBrick with one layer (the RasterLayer from above)
arts[[2]] <- artwork + 10 # Add second layer, e.g. based on first one
arts[[3]] <- calc(arts[[2]], function(x) {20 ^ x}) # Making third layer from second
names(arts) <- paste0("layer", 1:3)
```

_Note: for complex formulas on large datasets, the `calc()` function is more efficient than simple algebraic expressions such as for layer2 (see `?raster::calc`)._

How does the result look like?

```{r}
arts
```

```{r arts}
arts %>% 
  as.list %>% 
  lapply(spplot)
```

So now what?\
_**Let's write it!**_

```{r}
arts %>% 
  writeRaster("arts.tif")
```

But, I want to add 20 extra layers!\
**_(..._😣😮_...)_**

```{r}
arts2 <- 
  calc(artwork, 
       function(x) {-1:-20 * x}, # first layer = -1 * artwork
                                 # second layer = -2 * artwork
                                 # ....
       forceapply = TRUE)
names(arts2) <- paste0("neg_layer", 1:20)
# adding it to arts:
arts <- brick(list(arts, arts2))
# saving layer names for later use:
mynames <- names(arts)
```

```{r}
nlayers(arts)
```

```{r}
names(arts)
```


**Overwrite** the earlier written file:

```{r}
arts %>% 
  writeRaster("arts.tif",
              overwrite = TRUE)
```

That's about it!

### Reading a GeoTIFF file

Nothing can be more simple...

Reading a mono-layered GeoTIFF file with `raster()` gives back the `RasterLayer`:

```{r}
artwork_test <- raster("artwork.tif")
```

```{r}
artwork_test
```

Reading a multi-layered GeoTIFF file with `brick()` returns the `RasterBrick`:

```{r}
arts_test <- brick("arts.tif")
```

However:

```{r}
names(arts_test)
```

As you see, layer names are not saved in the GeoTIFF.
You define them in R:

```{r}
names(arts_test) <- mynames
arts_test
```
 
That's what we wanted!

The actual data are not loaded into memory, but read in chunks when performing operations.
This makes it convenient when using larger rasters:

```{r}
inMemory(arts_test)
```

Selecting a specific layer by its name:

```{r}
arts_test$neg_layer20
```


## How to make and use GeoPackages with raster layers (`*.gpkg`)

'GeoPackage' may sound new and unfamiliar to you -- more information can be found in [a separate post](../../articles/geospatial_standards/) on this website.

While its vector capabilities are already beautifully supported by GDAL and the `sf` package (demonstrated in the [other tutorial](../../tutorials/spatial_standards_vector/))), its raster capabilities are still less supported by GDAL and dependent applications such as the R-packages [raster](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg) and [stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/).
This is something we can expect to grow in the future.

GDAL's GPKG-raster driver itself is still less worked out than its drivers for GeoTIFF or GPKG-vector (note that one GPKG file can accommodate both layer types).
For example, only the _Byte, Int16, UInt16_ and _Float32_ datatypes can be written by GDAL, while for GeoTIFFs these are _Byte UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, CInt16, CInt32, CFloat32_ and _CFloat64_ ^[
See the GDAL [datatype definitions](https://gdal.org/api/raster_c_api.html#_CPPv412GDALDataType) -- note that `raster` uses its own abbreviations: `?raster::dataType`
].

From my experience, raster GeoPackage files are smaller than GeoTIFF files in the case of larger rasters.
This, and the capability to combine raster and vector layers, certainly make it worthwile to consider the GeoPackage format for rasters, if you're not hindered by the supported data types.


### Making a single-raster GeoPackage from a `RasterLayer` R object

This it is no more difficult than:

```{r}
artwork %>% 
  writeRaster("artwork.gpkg", format = "GPKG")
```

A bit more information on the 'missing value' warning can be found in GDAL's documentation of [GeoPackage raster](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gpkg.html#nodata-value).
You should know that the `raster` package does not yet officially support the GeoPackage! (see `?writeFormats()`)

However, the `stars` package (see [further)](#homework)) fully supports GDAL's capabilities, and therefore _is_ able to write multiple raster layers, as we will do in a minute.
Anyway, `raster::writeRaster` already works fine for single `RasterLayer` objects.

Reading the GeoPackage:

```{r}
artwork_gpkg <- raster("artwork.gpkg")
artwork_gpkg
```

Let's make sure: are the data we've read from the GeoTIFF identical to those from the GeoPackage?

```{r}
all.equal(artwork_test[], artwork_gpkg[])
```

Yeah!

Given that the GPKG-support of `raster` is limited, we're lucky that Edzer Pebesma -- the creator of `sf` -- has also made the amazing package `stars`!!

```{r}
unlink("artwork.gpkg") # delete gpkg; we're going to create it here again
Sys.setenv(GDAL_PAM_ENABLED = "NO") # prevents an auxiliary file being written next to *.gpkg
library(stars)
```

We could as well have written `artwork` to a GeoPackage with `stars`, so let's just see what we get by converting the `RasterLayer` object to a `stars` object and then apply `write_stars()`, hm?

```{r}
artwork %>% 
  st_as_stars %>% # this converts the RasterLayer to a stars object
  write_stars("artwork.gpkg",
              driver = "GPKG")
```

Reading it back with `stars::read_stars()`, followed by back-conversion to a `RasterLayer`:

```{r}
artwork_gpkg_stars <- 
  read_stars("artwork.gpkg") %>% 
  as("Raster")
artwork_gpkg_stars
```

And yes again, the data we've read from the GeoTIFF file are identical to those from the GeoPackage:

```{r}
all.equal(artwork_test[], artwork_gpkg_stars[])
```

That's it!

Knowing how to write and read with `stars` will help us for the multi-layer case!

### Making a multi-raster GeoPackage

Indeed, just as with vector layers, GeoPackage can accommodate multiple raster layers (or vector + raster layers).

Let's suppose we'd like to add `layer2` (a `RasterLayer`) from the `RasterBrick` object `arts`.

```{r}
arts$layer2
```

Unfortunately, the `raster` package does not support GDAL's options to add extra raster layers in a GPKG file:

```{r}
try(
  arts$layer2 %>% 
    writeRaster("artwork.gpkg", 
                format = "GPKG",
                options = c("RASTER_TABLE=layer2",
                            "APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES"))
)
```

So let's proceed with `stars`!

```{r}
arts$layer2 %>% 
  st_as_stars %>% 
  write_stars("artwork.gpkg",
              driver = "GPKG",
              options = c("RASTER_TABLE=layer2",
                          "APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES"))
```

Mind the `options` argument: those options are passed directly to GDAL's GPKG-raster driver, and they're documented [at GDAL](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gpkg.html#creation-options).

Over there we read:

> RASTER_TABLE=string. Name of tile user table. By default, based on the filename (i.e. if filename is foo.gpkg, the table will be called “foo”).
>
> APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES/NO: If set to YES, an existing GeoPackage will not be priorly destroyed, such as to be able to add new content to it. Defaults to NO.

Ahaa!

We got no errors above, but no feedback either...\
Thrilling!

Let's peek:

```{r}
gdalUtils::gdalinfo("artwork.gpkg") %>% 
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

Yay!\
It's interesting to see how the info at this level disregards CRS and extent.

When we query the metadata of one sublayer, it is seen that CRS and extent are layer-specific:

```{r}
gdalUtils::gdalinfo("artwork.gpkg", 
                    # provide metadata of first subdataset:
                    sd=1, 
                    # the following arguments just control formatting of the output:
                    approx_stats = TRUE, mm = TRUE, proj4 = TRUE) %>% 
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

`raster` will not help us for reading the layers.
But `read_stars()` is there to assist us!!

```{r}
# brick("artwork.gpkg") ## this won't work...
# but this will work:
artwork_gpkg2 <- 
  read_stars("artwork.gpkg", sub = "artwork", quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  as("Raster")
artwork_gpkg2
```

Wow!

Checking data again with GeoTIFF result:

```{r}
all.equal(artwork_test[], artwork_gpkg2[])
```

Same story for the other layer:

```{r}
read_stars("artwork.gpkg", sub = "layer2", quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  as("Raster")
```

Splendid.

By the way, this is how the full `stars` object looks like -- it holds information similar to a `RasterBrick`:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
read_stars("artwork.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)
```


## Homework: further explore the amazing `stars` package {#homework}

Enter deep hyperspace and explore the `stars` package, which stores multidimensional hypercubes...
Really, visit its [website](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) and never look (or turn?) back!

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(stars)
```

For now, my time's up and I'll just demonstrate how easy it is to transform a `Raster*` object into a `stars` object:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
interstellar <- 
  arts[[1:5]] %>% 
  st_as_stars()
interstellar
```

It does make sense, right?

What about:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
interstellar %>% split("band")
```


The `stars` package has a number of efficient geospatial algorithms that make it worth using, even for simple raster layers!

And sure, as seen above, you can read from files with `read_stars()`, write to files with `write_stars()`, convert to Raster* objects with `as("Raster")` and backconvert with `st_as_stars()`!


```{r include=FALSE}
unlink("art*")
```
