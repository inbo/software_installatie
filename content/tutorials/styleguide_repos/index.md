## Naming

* Use lowercase for repository, directory, and file names. For R-related files, use uppercase `R`.

* Use dash (`-`) to separate words in directory and file names. Don't use underscores.

* Avoid the use of dash (`-`) in the name of repositories that you intend for R package development (it is OK to use a dash in repository names for other purposes). Especially if you intend to publish the package at CRAN at some point. CRAN demands package names to comply with the following: "contain only (ASCII) letters, numbers and dot, have at least two characters and start with a letter and not end in a dot". Few packages include a dot in their name, so avoid this too.
